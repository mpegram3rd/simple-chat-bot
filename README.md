# Simple Chat Bot

This is a simple question/answer chat bot using the following tech stack:
- [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for Foundation Model
- Foundation Model: `Anthropic Claude V2`
- [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/langchain): For interacting with the model and hopefully chat memory later
- [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/): For simple Web UI

## Setup / Running
Initial Setup:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Running the app:
`python3 -m streamlit run main.py`

## Credits
The initial implementation was based off the fantastic tutorial by [Trevor Spires](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevspires/) 
in [this Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1-mUfpeRu0)
